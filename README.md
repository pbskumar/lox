# lox: A toy programming language

This repo is an implementation of `lox` language based on [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).


## Why?
I built the SQL parsing and transpiling library for [IoT SiteWise Query Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/sql.html). I never expected to enjoy working at the nitty-gritty level of AST traversals and optimizations, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. Coming from a non-CS background, I’ve always been fascinated by the “magic” behind languages and their interpreters or compilers. Now that I’ve gotten my hands dirty with lexing, parsing, AST traversal, and transpiling, I want to go all the way—build a language from scratch and really understand what happens under the hood of interpreters. And what better way than college class styled book!
